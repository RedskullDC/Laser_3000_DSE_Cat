Two pics showing Laser3000/CAT motherboards.

Notes:

LASER has a single BASIC ROM in a 23256, CAT has a 4x8KB board installed underneath (not visible).

CAT has an unpopulated memory Expander connector (J1 in the tech manual), LASER does not have this connector.
(Unsure if a board was ever made to connect to J1 ??)
